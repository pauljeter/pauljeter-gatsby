Depending on which MVC you ask, you will get various answers to this question. The creators of BackboneJS make it clear what a model is in a [BackboneJS](http://backbonejs.org/) application. From their documentation:

Models are the heart of any JavaScript application, containing the interactive data as well as a large part of the logic surrounding it: conversions, validations, computed properties, and access control.

So for the purpose of the tutorial let's create a model.

```JavaScript
Book = Backbone.Model.extend({
        initialize: function() {
            alert('Hello World');
    }
});

var book = new Book;
```

`initialize()` is triggered when a new instance of a model( models, collections and views work the same way ) are created. It’s not required to be included in your model declaration but you will find it useful more often than not.

## Setting attributes

Next, you will want to pass parameters when you create an instance of your model.

```JavaScript
Book = Backbone.Model.extend({
    initialize: function() {
        alert('Hello World');
    }
});

var book = new Book({
    title: 'To Kill a Mockingbird',
    author: 'Harper Lee'
});
// You can also set it afterwards
// These operations are equivelent
var book = new Book();
book.set({
    title: 'To Kill a Mockingbird',
    author: 'Harper Lee'
});
```

Therefor, passing a JavaScript object into our constructor is the same as calling model.set(). Now you can retrieve the attributes from these models.

## Getting attributes

You can access the model properties anytime after they have been set, using the model.get() method.

```JavaScript
Book = Backbone.Model.extend({
    initialize: function() {
        alert('Hello World');
    }
});

var book = new Book({
    title: 'To Kill a Mockingbird',
    author: 'Harper Lee'
});

var title = book.get('title'); // To Kill a Mockingbird
var author = book.get('author'); // Harper Lee
```

## Setting model defaults

Sometimes you will want your model to contain default values. This can easily be accomplished by setting a property name 'defaults' in your model declaration.

```JavaScript
Book = Backbone.Model.extend({
    defaults: {
        title: 'The Lord of the Rings',
        author: 'J.R.R. Tolkien '
    },
    initialize: function() {
        alert('Hello World');
    }
});

var book = new Book({
    title: 'To Kill a Mockingbird',
    author: 'Harper Lee'
});

var title = book.get('title'); // To Kill a Mockingbird
var author = book.get('author'); // Harper Lee
```

## Listening for changes to the model

Let’s talk about one of the more useful functionalities of a Backbone Model. All of the attributes of a model can have listeners bound to them. These listeners can detect changes to their values. In your initialize function, you can bind a function to be called every time the value of your attribute is changed. In this case, if the tile of our “book” changes, we will alert the new title.

```JavaScript
Book = Backbone.Model.extend({
    initialize: function() {
        alert('Hello World');
        this.on('change:title', function(model) {
            var title = model.get('title'); // '1984'
            alert('Changed my title to ' + title);
        });
    }
});

var book = new Book({
    title: 'To Kill a Mockingbird',
    author: 'Harper Lee'
});

book.set({
    title: '1984'
});
// This triggers a change and will alert()
```

You can bind the change listener to the individual attributes, or you can bind it to listen to all of the attributes in the model. Do this by using `this.on(‘change', function(model){});` without the `:attribute`.

This was a very basic overview of Backbone models. We will get more in-depth as the series goes on. Next, let’s look at <Link to="/blog/digging-into-backbonejs/collections">Collections</Link>.
